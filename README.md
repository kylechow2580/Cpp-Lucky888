# Cpp-Lucky888

This program is a Homework assginment. More details please have a look of requirement.pdf ^﹏^.

And this program is built by Visual Studio 2010 Professional, so the .sln file is not updated.

If you're interested to playing it, I have already compile the program using Visual Studio 2012. Just running the Lucky888.exe is OK.

All things is built by standard Visual C++.
